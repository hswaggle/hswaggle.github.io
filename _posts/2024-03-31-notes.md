#Site Structure#

##Digital Apothecary##
###Front of House - Potion symbols###

Recently finished works, that are relevant to my current thinking. 

###Works in Progress - mortar and pestle symbol###

Semi Finished works that are presentable for feedback, usually larger scale projects. 

###Store room - barrel symbol###

Old works, that could be either updated or reflected on. 

###Sub Structure - TBD if necessary###

Would be to classify works under broader subheadings, could lead to stagnation. Currently opposed.
